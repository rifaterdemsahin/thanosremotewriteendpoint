# 🚀 Thanos Endpoint Deployment with RemoteWrite on OpenShift

This repository contains the setup for deploying **Thanos** with **RemoteWrite** on an **OpenShift** cluster. It enables highly available and scalable storage for Prometheus metrics by leveraging Thanos components.

## 🎯 Objectives

The goal is to deploy a monitoring stack with Prometheus and Thanos to:
- **RemoteWrite** metrics from Prometheus to Thanos Receiver.
- Enable **high availability** and **long-term storage** of metrics.
- Create a **query layer** using Thanos Query to access metrics across multiple Prometheus instances.

## 🛠️ Components

The deployment includes the following key components:
- **Prometheus**: For metrics collection.
- **Thanos Sidecar**: To extend Prometheus with scalable, durable storage.
- **Thanos Receiver**: To receive metrics via RemoteWrite from Prometheus.
- **Thanos Query**: To query metrics from multiple sources.
- **Thanos Store Gateway**: (Optional) To enable long-term metric storage in object storage (S3, GCS, etc.).

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before starting the deployment, ensure that you have the following:
- An **OpenShift** cluster running.
- Access to the **oc CLI**.
- Permissions to create resources in the `monitoring` namespace.
- **Helm** installed (optional, for easier deployment).

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
```

### 2. Deploy Prometheus Operator

Run the following command to install the Prometheus Operator:

```bash
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/main/bundle.yaml
```

### 3. Deploy Prometheus

Apply the `prometheus-instance.yaml` configuration file to deploy a Prometheus instance with RemoteWrite enabled:

```bash
oc apply -f prometheus-instance.yaml
```

### 4. Deploy Thanos Sidecar

The Thanos Sidecar will be attached to Prometheus for scalable metrics storage. Deploy it using:

```bash
oc apply -f thanos-sidecar.yaml
oc apply -f thanos-config.yaml
```

### 5. Deploy Thanos Receiver

Set up the Thanos Receiver to receive metrics via Prometheus RemoteWrite:

```bash
oc apply -f thanos-receiver.yaml
```

### 6. Deploy Thanos Query

Thanos Query will allow querying across multiple Prometheus instances. Deploy it using:

```bash
oc apply -f thanos-query.yaml
```

Optionally, expose the Thanos Query service:

```bash
oc apply -f thanos-query-service.yaml
```

### 7. (Optional) Deploy Thanos Store Gateway

For long-term metric storage, you can deploy Thanos Store Gateway:

```bash
oc apply -f thanos-store.yaml
```

## 🔧 Configuration Details

- The `prometheus-instance.yaml` is configured to use **RemoteWrite** to send metrics to the Thanos Receiver.
- The Thanos components are deployed with the necessary configurations to enable **querying**, **storing**, and **receiving** metrics.
- Thanos supports **S3** or other object storage for long-term metric storage. Modify the `thanos-config` ConfigMap to include your object store credentials.
